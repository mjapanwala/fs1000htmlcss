      What is my current portfolio?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I am currently pursuing my Fullstack Developer certificate at York University. This certificate focuses on the front-end as well as the backend of a website.
      The program started in September 2019 and has now been over a month since ive started my journey. My journey began with HTML soon after CSS and currently learning 
      the fundamentals of Javascript.
      I have a thorough understanding of HTML as its the essentially the structure of the website and the main component one must understand when web developing, this took
      me a few days to understand. A lot of my resources 
      were online tutorials, books and school resources from class. Afterwards, i started the more design aspect through the use of CSS, this taught me several 
      different concepts from text align, font, colours, opacity, display
      and much more. This wasa an easier concept to grasp but the applicability of doing it at a higher standard was much more 
      complex. This took me several weeks and then started to explore further into javascript. Javascript was significantly more 
      advanced and took me couple weeks to understand the concept behind it. I am now striving to
      master javascript by continuously spending more time dedicated to it.
